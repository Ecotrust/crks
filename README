The Copper River Knowledge System Flex Client allows users to visualize and discover 
geospatial data for the Copper River Knowledge System.  Multiple WMS geoserver layers 
can be loaded and manipulated simultaneously.

## Dependencies
- Download swc files for following projects and place in libs directory
- SWIZ Framework version 1.1 (swiz-framework-v1.3.1.swc) http://swizframework.org/
- Google maps version 1.20 (map_flex_1_20.swc) http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/flash/

## Compiling with Flex SDK
- Download the Flex 4.1 SDK (http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4)
- Unzip the sdk folder to a stable directory

## Compiling with Flash Builder IDE
- Install Flash Builder
- Install Flex 4.1 SDK if it's not included with Flash Builder
- Copy html-template/index.template.html to somewhere outside of the project (creating a new project will overwrite it)
- In Flash Builder, create a new Flex project and choose the crks project directory
- Choose Flex 4.1 SDK and no server technology, then press Next
- Accept bin-debug as debug output, press Next
- In the Library window, add the Swiz and Google Maps swcs
- In the Main application file setting, choose CRKS.mxml
- Choose finish
- Copy config-dev.xml.example to config.dev.xml, adjust properties as needed for development environment
- Open project properties, choose Flex Compiler pane, and set Additional compiler arguments to -load-config+=config-dev.xml
- Copy the backup of index.template.html back into html-template/index.template.html (overwrite the generic version)

## Apache Ant
- Install Apache Ant if needed (note: Ant comes bundled with Eclipse, but the following jars still have to be added to the lib folder and Eclipse Ant classpath)
- Copy flexTasks.jar from the Flex SDK's ant/lib folder or Flash Builder's sdks/4.1.0/ant/lib folder to Ant's lib folder
- To enable remote deployment, download jsch.jar and place in Ant's lib folder
- Make sure that both of these jars are readable by your user

## Building 
- Copy build.properties.example to build.properties and set variables to match deployment config
- Get new google api map key for host at http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html and set in build.properties
- Be sure crossdomain.xml (html-template/crossdomain.xml) file is present at deployment webroot (www.yourdomain.com/crossdomain.xml).
  If deploying to root, file will be included automatically with build.
- Run Ant compile task to compile project to target directory (ant compile)
- Run Ant deploy task to deploy project to server (ant deploy)
